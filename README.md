Movie Recommendation System.

Movie are part of the life and while watching movie who doesnâ€™t want to see related
movie basis on their interest. In this project, we create a system of recommendations for a
company that deals with movies. Based on user data, our recommendation engine recommends
movies. The programming language Python is used to implement the system. It collects
information from the user's behaviour and suggests movies to the user based on that
information. This Project describes an approach to a movie recommendation system using Cosinee Similarity to recommend similar movies based on the one chosen by the user. Complete backend coding is provided in this project.
